Youth Risk Behavior: Obesity Pattern Among youth And The Influence Of Nutritional Behavior And Physical Activity.
Aim: The main objective of this visualization is to help the analyst to identify the prime cause of obesity in different groups of the youth population. The groups are based on gender, grade
and ethnicity. Also to see if there is any pattern for different states. Few questions we are attempting to address through this visualization project is as below: 

★ Year wise obesity trend in each state. 
★ Year wise obesity trend at country level. 
★ Year wise obesity trend of each population group both at state and country level 
★ Influence of race-ethnicity on the behavior of students:fruits and vegetables-behavior, physical activity- behavior, television viewing- behavior and impact on obesity/weight status. 
★ How does the grade influence the race-ethnicity of the student to impact the various categories of the students like students who have obesity, eat less than 1 fruit a day, eat less than 1 veggies a day, overweight classification, 3+ hrs tv each school day, participate in daily physical education, 1+ hr of daily physical activity , drinking soda/pop min 1 time a day.
★ Is there any trend over years to notice the common behavior between students in a state sharing different grades?
